# Summary of Thought Process
The connect 4 web app is made with ReactJS. I used React because it was the easiest library to make a efficient connect 4 game with minimal code. 
# How To Run
After downloading the app , in the project directory run **npm install** followed by **npm start** to view the page on your localhost.
# Demo
The app is also hosted online at https://garyli2198.github.io/connect4-react/
